## Overview
NeuroRide is an AI-powered computer vision project designed to detect helmets and number plates in real-time video streams. It identifies motorcyclists without helmets and marks their number plates for further processing.

## Features
- Helmet Detection: Detects whether a rider is wearing a helmet.
- Number Plate Recognition: Uses OCR to extract number plate details.
- Automated Processing: Marks number plates of violators and tracks them.
- User Interface: Clicking a button moves detected number plates to a list with a path-tracing effect, while the video continues playing in a mini-player.

## Tech Stack
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries & Frameworks: OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Ultralytics YOLO, EasyOCR
- UI Framework: Streamlit/Flask

## Installation
 ``` sh

```
